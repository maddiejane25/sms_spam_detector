# sms_spam_detector
Module 21 Challenge

## Overview
In this challenge, I built a web-based app using Gradio to predict if a text is spam or not spam. Using a dataset of labeled data, the functions sms_classification and sms_prediction were used first to classify the dataset, and then predict based on that knowledge. 

## Findings
These texts were tested on the app.
  <br>You are a lucky winner of $5000! The app has determined *Not Spam*.
  <br>You won 2 free tickets to the Super Bowl. The app has determined *Spam*.
  <br>You won 2 free tickets to the Super Bowl text us to claim your prize. The app has determined *Spam*.
  <br>Thanks for registering. Text 4343 to receive free updates on medicare. The app has determined *Spam*.
  <br>
  <br>
I was surprised by these findings, I would have guessed the last one was not Spam and the first text was.

## Usage
To launch the app on a public URL, go to https://b8b78c7c074cbdf311.gradio.live within 72 hours of submission to experience the live version (Jan 26, 2025)

## Conclusions
The application was able to predict if texts were SPAM, which could help people filter their messages for dangerous texts.

## Acknowledgements
My Python file was created using Google Colab. I also used the help of the Xpert Learning Assistant.
